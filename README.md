# StudentHub
Developed and implemented a student management system in C/C++ to manage student details, including adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving information based on roll numbers or course enrollment. The system uses structured data storage and file management techniques to save and load student data persistently. In the C++ version, employed modern object-oriented concepts like std::string and streams for file I/O, ensuring flexibility and ease of maintenance. The C implementation uses procedural methods with fixed-size arrays and efficient file handling through fopen and fwrite. Both versions handle input validation, error handling, and ensure seamless data manipulation with efficient memory management.
